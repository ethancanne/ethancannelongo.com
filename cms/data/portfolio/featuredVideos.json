      "title": "The Give Water Project Documentary",
      "description": "The Give Water Project is a gospel-centered initiative that serves various unreached villages around India and Nepal to provide clean drinking water through the construction of water wells.  This effort protects marginalized, low-caste people groups from water-borne illnesses and restores their hope in the name of Jesus.  This initiative creates opportunities to plant churches and make disciples of Jesus Christ in these remote areas. I had the privilege of traveling to many of these villages, speaking with individuals who have been both physically and spiritually impacted from these water wells, recording their testimonies, and creating this documentary to share how this ministry is advancing the great commission.",
