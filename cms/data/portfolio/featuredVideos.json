      "description": "Genesis of Hope is a ministry dedicated to taking action against the rising poverty crisis in India by establishing “Hope” children centers around the country.  These centers provide essential education and skill training to children who otherwise wouldn’t have access to learning opportunities, helping children realize their potential and God given purpose. Within these dark and often hostile environments, Genesis of Hope brings the light of the Gospel of Jesus Christ into these communities.  I had the opportunity to work extensively with Genesis of Hope and create this documentary to show the work the Lord is doing in and through this ministry.",
